restaurant_page

A website made from DOM manipulation, with all HTML elements being inserted using vanilla JS. All are appended to a <div> element inside the HTML file and CSS styles are added accordingly. 

It is the first project to make use of the import/export component of ES6 modules, creating multiple files to increase readability and easier tracking of bugs. I also applied teachings from the previous lessons regarding Webpack and npm.
